Add functionality and flexibility to DataTimeSeries class.

dataseries.py:
    - Implement auto-filter to filter data automatically as data is added.
    - Add ability to bind functions to pre_filter and post_filter so custom processing can be performed on the data before and after auto-filter.
    - Change get_head method to get_data, which now accepts an index argument.
    - Change print_head method to print_data, which now accepts an index argument.
    - Add data2str method, which accepts index argument.
