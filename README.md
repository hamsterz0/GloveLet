# GloveLet
## Light-weight User Interface Glove
<br>GloveLet is a user interface glove we are developing as our senior-design project.
We are utilizing OpenCV tracking as well as flex sensors and IMU to track
gestures and motion of the user's hand and translate these motions and gestures
into mouse functions, such as left/right click, along with other actions users
will find intuitive and convenient.
